# metalsmith-concat

A Metalsmith plugin to concatenate files.

## Installation

```javascript
$ npm install metalsmith-concat
```

## Usage

### CLI

```javascript
{
  "plugins": {
    "metalsmith-concat": {
      "files": "styles/**/*.css",
      "output": "styles/app.css"
    }
  }
}
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
var MetalSmith = require('metalsmith');
var concat = require('metalsmith-concat');

Metalsmith(__dirname)
  .use(concat({
    files: 'styles/**/*.css',
    output: 'styles/app.css'
  }))
  .build();
```

#### files
Type: `String` / `String[]`
Default: `'**/*'`

This defines which files are concatenated. This string will be interpreted as a
[minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) pattern. An array of strings
will be interpreted as minimatch patterns, in this case the order of the
patterns matters (it will determine the order in which the files are
concatenated).

#### output
Type: `String`

It represents the filepath where the concatenated content will be outputted.
This option is **mandatory**.

#### forceOutput
Type: `Boolean`
Default: `false`

By default metalsmith-concat return an error if the output file already exists.
You can force an existing output file to be overwritten by setting this option
to `true`.

#### keepConcatenated
Type: `Boolean`
Default: `false`

Whether to keep the files which were concatenated. By default they are not kept
and deleted from the build (thus only keeping the newly created file at
`options.output`).

#### insertNewLine
Type: `Boolean` / `String`
Default: `true`

Whether a trailing new line (`\n`) should be appended after each concatenated
file. Unless you face a problem, you should keep this option on as removing it
could cause invalid concatenated files (see [this
article](http://evanhahn.com/newline-necessary-at-the-end-of-javascript-files/)).
It is also possible to pass a string, in which case it will be used instead of
`\n`.
